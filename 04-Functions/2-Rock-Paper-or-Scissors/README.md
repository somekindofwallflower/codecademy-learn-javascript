###Rock, Paper, or Scissors

Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

    <li>Scissors cut paper.</li>
    <li>Paper covers rock.</li>
    <li>If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.</li>
