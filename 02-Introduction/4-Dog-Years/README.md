### Dog Years
Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?

Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:

<ul>
    <li>The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
    </li>
    <li>Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
    </li>
</ul>
