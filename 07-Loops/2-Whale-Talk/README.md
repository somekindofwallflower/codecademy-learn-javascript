###Whale Talk
Take a phrase like ‘turpentine and turtles’ and translate it into its “whale talk” equivalent: ‘UUEEIEEAUUEE’.

There are a few simple rules for translating text to whale language:

<ul>
    <li>There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding “y”.</li>
    <li>The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them in our program.</li>
</ul>

Once we have converted text to the whale language, the result is sung slowly, as is a custom in the ocean.
